Astro stands on the shoulders of giantsâ€”the foundations of Astro can be found in writing, technical deep-dives, and various open source projects around the web. We're extremely grateful for all the thought others have put into these topics, and Astro wouldn't be here without that.

Jason and Addy's 2019 article _Rendering on the Web_ is a great deep-dive into the many architectural approaches for building performant websites and their trade-offs. If you're looking for an introduction to common terminology like Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and (re)hydration, this is a perfect place to start.

### Nate Moore ([@n_moore](https://twitter.com/n_moore)) and Trevor Schmidt ([@eyelidlessness](https://twitter.com/eyelidlessness))

Nate (who now works on Astro) and Trevor's project Microsite proved that these concepts could (and should) be abstracted into an easy-to-use framework. There's a pretty direct line from Microsite to Astro, especially considering Nate's involvement in both projects.

### Markus Oberlehner ([@maoberlehner](https://twitter.com/maoberlehner))

Markus' explorations of various partial hydration implementations for Preact and Vue, heavily inspired Astro's client-side hydration implementations. If you think `:visible` is an awesome idea, thank Markus!

### Lukas Bombach ([@luke_schmuke](https://twitter.com/luke_schmuke))

Lukas' article on implementing partial hydration with Next.js and Preact was an eye-opening exploration of an early technique for partial hydration and the enormous benefits it could offer.
